# Module_5_Challenge

## Create two financial analysis tools with a single Jupyter notebook:

### Part 1: Create a Financial Planner for Emergencies

__*Preconditions:*__

- The average monthly household income for each credit union member is $12,000.
- Create two variables called my_btc and my_eth. Set them equal to 1.2 and 5.3, respectively.
- Create two variables named my_agg and my_spy and set them equal to 200 and 50, respectively.


__Result: Savings are greater than emergency fund (3 times your monthly income)__


### Part 2: Create a Financial Planner for Retirement

__*Preconditions:*__

- 40/60 portfolio: the 60% stocks (SPY) and 40% bonds (AGG) composition of the portfolio
- a Monte Carlo Simulation of 500 runs and 30 years for the portfolio
- Given an initial investment of $20,000, calculate the expected portfolio return in dollars at the 95% lower and upper confidence intervals.
- Calculate the expected portfolio return at the 95% lower and upper confidence intervals based on a 50% increase in the initial investment.
- Adjust the weights of the retirement portfolio so that the composition for the Monte Carlo simulation consists of 20% bonds (AGG) and 80% stocks (SPY).
