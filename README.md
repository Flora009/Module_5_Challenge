# Module_5_Challenge

## Create two financial analysis tools with a single Jupyter notebook:

### Part 1: Create a Financial Planner for Emergencies

__*Preconditions:*__

- The average monthly household income for each credit union member is $12,000.
- Create two variables called my_btc and my_eth. Set them equal to 1.2 and 5.3, respectively.
- Create two variables named my_agg and my_spy and set them equal to 200 and 50, respectively.


__Result: Savings are greater than emergency fund (3 times your monthly income)__


### Part 2: Create a Financial Planner for Retirement

__*Preconditions:*__

1. 30-year simulation

- 40/60 portfolio: the 60% stocks (SPY) and 40% bonds (AGG) composition of the portfolio
- a Monte Carlo Simulation of 500 runs and 30 years for the portfolio
- Given an initial investment of $20,000, calculate the expected portfolio return in dollars at the 95% lower and upper confidence intervals.
- Calculate the expected portfolio return at the 95% lower and upper confidence intervals based on a 50% increase in the initial investment.

2. 10-year simulation

- Adjust the weights of the retirement portfolio so that the composition for the Monte Carlo simulation consists of 20% bonds (AGG) and 80% stocks (SPY).


Analyze the Retirement Portfolio Forecasts (5 points)
To receive all points, you must:

Answer the following question in your Jupyter notebook:

What are the lower and upper bounds for the expected value of the portfolio with a 95% confidence interval? (5 points)
Forecast Cumulative Returns in 10 Years (5 points)
To receive all points, you must:

Answer the following questions in your Jupyter notebook:

Using the current value of the stock and bond portion of the member's portfolio, as well as the summary statistics that you generated from the new Monte Carlo simulation, what are the lower and upper bounds for the expected value of the portfolio (with the new weights) with a 95% confidence interval? (2 points)

Will weighting the portfolio more heavily toward stocks allow the credit union members to retire after only 10 years? (3 points)
